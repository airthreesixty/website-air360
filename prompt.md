I am translating the documentation into Japanese
Translate the Markdown content I'll paste later.

You must strictly follow the rules below.

- Never change the Markdown markup structure. Don't add or remove links. Do not change any URL.
- Never change the contents of code blocks even if they appear to have a bug.
- Always preserve the original line breaks. Do not add or remove blank lines.
<!-- - Never touch the permalink such as `{/*examples*/}` at the end of each heading. -->
- Never touch HTML-like tags such as `<Notes>`.
- Do not wrap the text in ```markdown``` or any code block syntax.
- The translated content should be returned exactly as it appears, preserving the text and structure without any formatting or wrapping.
- Retain any tags, attributes, or special symbols as-is. Do not treat them as code or add any syntax highlighting.
- Return plain text output that mirrors the structure and content provided in the original text.
