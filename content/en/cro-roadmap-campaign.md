What is CRO
#description
Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) is a systematic process of improving a website or landing page to increase the percentage of visitors who take a desired action. This desired action, known as a "conversion," can vary depending on the goals of a website or business, but common examples include making a purchase, filling out a contact form, subscribing to a newsletter, or downloading a resource.

CRO involves analyzing user behavior, conducting tests, and making data-driven changes to the website's design, content, and functionality to make it more effective at persuading visitors to convert. The ultimate aim is to maximize the value you get from your website traffic and digital marketing efforts.
