As eCommerce grows more competitive by the minute, it is important to take the time to optimize your store to make sure you can battle the competition, increase your eCommerce conversion rates and gain revenue. Here are 6 ways to get started.

## Reduce the number of steps in your checkout process

We all like to follow simple steps on a website, particularly when we’re trying to finalize a purchase. Showing customers where they are in the purchase process reassures shoppers and can improve eCommerce conversion rates.

The number of steps your store will need will depend on the products you’re selling or the products a customer wants to purchase. For example, if a customer is purchasing a physical product, you’ll need a stage in your checkout process where shoppers can input their address; if a customer is purchasing a digital product, then entering a physical address won’t be necessary. 

An easy way to give your customers an estimation of how many steps there will be in your checkout process is by displaying a progress bar.
