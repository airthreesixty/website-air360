As eCommerce grows more competitive by the minute, it is important to take the time to optimize your store to make sure you can battle the competition, increase your eCommerce conversion rates and gain revenue. Here are 6 ways to get started.

## Reduce the number of steps in your checkout process
We all like to follow simple steps on a website, particularly when we’re trying to finalize a purchase. Showing customers where they are in the purchase process reassures shoppers and can improve eCommerce conversion rates.

The number of steps your store will need will depend on the products you’re selling or the products a customer wants to purchase. For example, if a customer is purchasing a physical product, you’ll need a stage in your checkout process where shoppers can input their address; if a customer is purchasing a digital product, then entering a physical address won’t be necessary. 

An easy way to give your customers an estimation of how many steps there will be in your checkout process is by displaying a progress bar.

## A/B test everything
A/B testing is one of the best ways to improve your store’s conversion rate. Comparison testing copy, imagery, etc. lets you identify which elements are resonating with your shoppers and which are not. Some common A/B tests include:

- CTA copy or design 
- Product description copy 
- Percent discount vs. dollars off
- CTA and other button placement 
- Testing out different promotions and offers.

The great thing about A/B testing is that you can gradually test and optimize different parts of your website and store. 

For example, if you were looking to simplify the buyer journey, you could view the pages your customers are visiting when they make a purchase through a platform such as Google Analytics and remove any pages that are clogging up the customer journey or aren’t being visited. You could then monitor your analytics over the next few weeks/months to see if the pages you remove have an impact on your eCommerce conversion rates.

## Host product drops and flash sales
People love sale events and all good ones come with expiry dates. Shoppers – especially brand super-fans – love being the first to get their hands on the latest thing from their favorite brands.

Hosting flash sales and product drops lets you tap into shopper FOMO, delight fans and improve eCommerce conversion rates. You can segment your audience to make sure you’re offering access to customers that are the most likely to buy.

## Abandoned cart reminders
Abandoned cart reminders are a great way to get ‘almost customers’ to make purchases. Visitors tend to add items to their cart, get distracted, and navigate off your site without completing checkout. 

Try an abandoned cart campaign to drive customers back and complete the transaction (and ultimately improve your eCommerce conversion rates). These campaigns can include reminder emails or text messages.

## Personalize the purchase journey
Every customer has a different purchase journey. For example, Jane could be buying headphones to listen to music. Meanwhile John could be buying them to speak to his work colleagues during Teams meetings. 

Knowing why your customer is buying your product and then customizing the product and landing page based on that knowledge can improve eCommerce conversion rates.

**How do you do this?**

You should be creating separate landing pages and product pages for each customer type. 

So, let’s say you own a headphone manufacturing company and your customer subscribed to your email list through the opt-in form with a freebie for one month of Amazon music. 

You now know that the customer is interested in music and is trying to find better listening technology. This information can be used to guide every subscriber on that list to a unique, personalized landing page.

Personalized emails, recommendations, and landing pages show customers that you know what they want and can give them the solution.

## Optimize your site navigation
Keeping things simple, adding categories, and making your website easy to navigate can increase your conversions. You should have every important category at your customers’ fingertips so that you make their purchase journey that much easier. 

If you’re looking to optimize site navigation, testing platforms let you see how easily users who fit your target market or customer navigate your store.

## Conclusion
Optimizing your eCommerce conversion rates is an ongoing process but committing to it leads to improved customer loyalty and increased revenue.
