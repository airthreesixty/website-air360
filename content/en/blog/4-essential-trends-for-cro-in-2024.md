Well, there is no shortcut for that, because every website / eCommerce has its own 
ecosystem, audience and behavior, but we can tell you some key strategies you should take 
into account this 2024 to ensure you achieve your CRO goals. 

Staying ahead of the curve is essential for businesses aiming to maximize their online 
success. [Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)](/en/blog/navigating-the-maze-of-ecommerce-conversion-rate-optimization/) plays a pivotal role in achieving this goal by 
ensuring that website visitors not only convert but also have a seamless and engaging user 
experience. As we step into 2024, let's explore the CRO trends that are poised to shape the 
industry and the crucial role of UX analytics in this journey.

## CRO Trend 1: AI-Powered Personalization
As businesses strive to provide a seamless and personalized customer experience, AI-
powered [personalization](/en/blog/personalise-and-target-new-customers-with-first-party-data/) is emerging as a crucial trend in the world of conversion rate 
optimization (CRO). Leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, 
organizations can utilize vast amounts of data to understand customer preferences and 
tailor their offerings accordingly. This level of customization not only enhances the customer 
experience but also delivers improved conversion rates and increased customer loyalty.

With the help of user experience analytics, organizations can gather real-time data on user 
behavior, preferences, and interactions. This data fuels AI algorithms, enabling websites to 
make instant, data-driven decisions that enhance personalization and boost conversions.

From dynamic pricing based on user preferences to personalised product recommendations, 
AI offers a myriad of possibilities. Implementing AI-driven chatbots for real-time customer 
interactions is another trend gaining traction, providing instant support and guidance to 
users throughout their journey.

We are also seeing an increase in AI tools or apps to help users find what they are looking for
more easily, such as size guides, product finders or optimised search bars. Let's take a look 
at some examples!

## CRO Trend 2: Mobile UX Mastery
In 2024, businesses are all about making sure your experience is smooth no matter where 
you find them. UX analytics helps by spotting any problems when you move between 
different places where a business advertises. By combining insights from all these places, 
businesses can understand how people behave and make the experience even better, 
leading to more sales.

Mobile phones are super important for online shopping now. Around 60% of all sales happen 
on mobiles. That's why it's a good idea to design websites with mobiles in mind. Keep things 
simple, make it easy for people to find what they want, and remember to check how your 
site works on both mobiles and computers.
Things to consider when optimizing your website for mobile:

- **Less is more.** Cut any unnecessary content, as users likely aren’t viewing 
information lower down on the page. You can find this information in heatmaps and 
scrollmaps.
- **Make things simple for users.** When the user is on a mobile device, they want the
website to be quick and simple to navigate. Ensure the navigation is easy to use and 
find what the customer is looking for. Tracking clicks in Google Analytics will help you 
determine which categories are most clicked on.
- **Mobile versus desktop.** Test and analyze how things are performing for mobile 
versus desktop. Something you think might be a clear-cut winner may, in fact, be a 
loss!
- **Content Prioritization:** Prioritize content placement for mobile-first design, 
ensuring important information is at the top of the page.
- **Typography:** Opt for easily readable fonts, particularly those with taller lowercase 
letters (x-height), for improved legibility on smaller screens.
- **Button Sizing:** Size buttons appropriately for mobile devices, ensuring they are 
large enough for comfortable tapping and providing adequate spacing between them 
to prevent accidental clicks.

This could be your template for mobile-first success:

## CRO Trend 3: Experimentation for Continuous Improvement

Experimentation is the cornerstone of CRO success in 2024. Embracing an iterative 
approach, businesses continually test and refine their strategies based on data-driven 
insights. UX analytics facilitates the tracking of experiment results, enabling organizations to
make informed decisions and fine-tune their conversion optimization tactics.

Leveraging Data Analysis and [A/B Testing](/en/blog/the-perfect-match-of-ab-testing-and-air360/): The first pillar involves harnessing the power of 
data analysis and A/B testing. With Google Optimize becoming redundant many businesses 
will stop A/B testing their landing pages, messaging, and pricing. This is where you can gain 
a competitive advantage. By investing in A/B testing tools, you can fine-tune your website 
and marketing strategies, potentially doubling your click-through and conversion rates. This 
approach isn't just about keeping up; it's about leading the race.

Solutions like AB Tasty and Kameleeon help you dynamize your experiments. 

Having these Experimentation tools connected to a UX analytics ecosystem like Air360 can 
help you have a more holistic understanding of the impact of each action /experiment you 
deploy and truly understand the behavioral change.

## CRO Trend 4: Video Content Optimization
Video content is a potent tool for engaging users, and its role in CRO is becoming more 
prominent. UX analytics helps measure video engagement and gather user feedback. Quick 
analysis of video performance data is essential for optimizing content and ensuring it aligns 
with user expectations.

Video has also increased significantly in the last few years and is a great way to grab users’ 
attention. Adding videos to your website can greatly increase interactions with your product 
pages or homepage content. Whether it's product demonstrations, customer testimonials, or
brand storytelling, videos have the power to evoke emotions and build trust.

As always, testing videos on your website is essential, as there could be some drawbacks. 
For example, ensure the video is an optimal length, as you do not want to impact site speed 
or the experience for users on mobile data.

Here are some key strategies to optimize your video content for maximum conversions:

- **Compelling and Relevant Videos:** Create videos that are not only visually 
appealing but also relevant to your target audience and the products or services you 
offer. The videos should align with your brand's messaging and capture the interest 
of your target market.
- **Optimized Video Placement:** Carefully consider the placement of your video 
content on your website. It should be strategically placed to ensure maximum 
visibility and engagement. Placing videos above the fold or on landing pages can 
significantly increase your chances of driving conversions.
- **Short and Concise Videos:** Keep your videos short and concise to maintain the 
attention of your audience. Research shows that viewers tend to lose interest after a 
few seconds, so it's important to deliver your key message within the first few 
seconds of the video. Use attention-grabbing visuals and compelling storytelling to 
engage viewers from the start.
- **Clear Call-to-Action:** Include a clear and compelling call-to-action (CTA) within your 
video content. Whether it's encouraging viewers to make a purchase, sign up for a 
newsletter, or take any other desired action, a strong CTA can guide your viewers 
towards the conversion funnel.
- **Mobile-Friendly Videos:** With the increasing use of mobile devices for browsing and
shopping, it's crucial to optimize your videos for mobile viewing. Ensure that your 
videos are responsive and compatible with different screen sizes and resolutions. This
will provide a seamless viewing experience for your mobile users, ultimately driving 
higher conversion rates.

As we look ahead to 2024, it's evident that staying ahead of the curve in Conversion Rate 
Optimization (CRO) requires more than just following the old playbook. Classic 
recommendations like personalization and simplified checkouts are no longer enough to 
ensure success in today's competitive landscape.

With each website and eCommerce platform having its own unique ecosystem, audience, 
and behavior, it's essential to adapt to emerging trends to achieve your CRO goals.

However, it's not just about implementing these trends blindly. Having a robust analytics 
stack is crucial for making informed decisions and maximizing the effectiveness of your CRO 
efforts. By leveraging tools like user experience analytics, businesses can gather real-time 
data on user behavior, preferences, and interactions. This data fuels AI algorithms, enabling 
websites to make instant, data-driven decisions that enhance personalization and boost 
conversions.

Moreover, [a sophisticated analytics stack](https://www.air360.io/en/request-demo) frees up valuable time that would otherwise be 
spent crunching numbers. Instead, businesses can focus on what really matters – 
understanding their customers and optimizing their strategies accordingly. In digital 
commerce, staying informed, adaptable, and data-driven is key to thriving and 
outperforming the competition.
