- **Avoid ”Dark Patterns”:** Avoid deceptive practices in purchase options and 
be transparent, like default selections that might trick users into subscribing 
to a product when they intend to make a one-time purchase.

**Actions:**
- **Coupons:** Streamline the coupon application experience. Instead of placing 
the coupon code entry at the end of the checkout process, integrate it at the 
beginning or within the cart page itself. This positioning makes it more user-
friendly and can prevent cart abandonment due to users searching for 
coupon codes at the last minute.

### Streamlining the Checkout Process
**Goal:** [The checkout process](/en/blog/how-to-reduce-annoying-checkout-form-fills/) should be straightforward, clear, and specifically 
focused on completing the purchase without distractions or confusion.

**Actions:**
- **Clear information display:** Display all necessary information like order 
summary, delivery date, shipping costs, and taxes clearly at this point. This 
transparency helps in building trust and reduces the likelihood of customers 
abandoning the checkout due to uncertainty or surprises.
- **No distractions or Threshold messages:** Eliminate any distractions, 
including navigation to other store sections and threshold messages that 
encourage adding more items to reach a certain goal (like free shipping). 
Such prompts can lead customers away from completing their checkout, 
increasing the risk of cart abandonment.
- **Visible progress indicator:** A clear progress indicator should show the 
steps in the checkout process, helping users understand their current position
and what remains, reducing confusion and anxiety.

Remember, it's these small adjustments and attention to detail that can 
significantly impact your campaign's conversion potential.

## 3. Prioritizing A/B Testing Based on User Journey Analysis
Having the ability to track the full user journey and campaign experience is 
invaluable, especially during peak traffic times. It allows for real-time identification 
of critical areas in the conversion funnel, such as pages with high traffic, high 
conversions, or significant drop-off rates. This insight is crucial for on-the-fly 
optimizations.

### In-Situ Optimization Strategy
For instance, if you notice a high drop-off rate on specific product pages during the 
Christmas period, where ads like Google search and social media are directing 
traffic, it's a clear signal to prioritize these pages for immediate optimization and 
[A/B testing](/en/blog/the-perfect-match-of-ab-testing-and-air360/). By analyzing user behavior on these pages, such as time spent and 
interaction with purchase buttons, you can quickly implement changes. If these 
tweaks lead to improved performance, consider extending them across similar 
pages to maximize overall conversions.

This approach, facilitated by a robust analytics tool, ensures you're not just 
collecting data but actively using it to enhance user experience and increase 
conversions as the campaign unfolds.

- **Other Experiments good to test during peak season:**
The high-traffic period of the year is an excellent opportunity to conduct 
experiments to boost your campaign performance. Here are some strategic tests 
you can try.

- **Simple Product Image First:** Start with a clear, simple product image against a 
white background. This approach helps customers immediately understand what 
they are purchasing, reducing confusion and potentially improving conversion rates.

**Up-sell Visibility:** Ensure that up-sells are prominently displayed on your site. 
Effective placement of up-sells not only increases the average order value but also 
introduces customers to additional products they might be interested in.

- **Elevate Social Proof:** Place customer reviews higher on your product pages. An 
experiment by Oodie showed a positive increase in conversions, with reviews being 
more visible. This makes it easier for customers to find and read reviews, enhancing
trust and potentially boosting sales.
This test from Oodie saw a positive response with an increase of 0.45%, which 
annually estimates to an increased revenue of $500K
People LOVE reviews, and usually, they’re hidden away under all of the product 
information, or users may need to click to expand reviews. Make seeing reviews 
easier for them by testing different placements.

Incorporating these changes and then closely monitoring their impact can provide 
valuable insights into customer preferences and behaviors, allowing you to refine 
your strategy for even better results.

## 4. Build a BF & CM Post Purchase Funnel
Building a post-purchase funnel for Black Friday and Cyber Monday (BFCM) is an 
effective strategy to increase the average order value. This approach focuses on 
cross-selling and up-selling to customers who have already made a purchase, 
targeting them with offers that are more likely to convert since they're already 
engaged and interested in your products.

For BF & CM, you can enhance this strategy by:
- **Offering High-Margin Items:** Cross-sell items like gift-wrapping services or 
offer discounted gift cards. These high-margin add-ons can be attractive to 
customers looking for convenience or planning future purchases.
- **Segmentation Based on Customer Behavior:** Use the data from your 
customers' shopping behavior to segment them effectively. This 
segmentation allows for more personalized and targeted post-purchase 
marketing efforts.
- **Leveraging Marketing Automation:** Integrate these customer segments 
into your marketing automation system. Send personalized messages tailored
to their shopping preferences and behavior. This personal touch can 
significantly increase the likelihood of additional purchases.

Such a post-purchase strategy not only boosts your revenue but also enhances the 
customer experience by offering them relevant and valuable products or services 
after their initial purchase.

As Black Friday and Cyber Monday are almost here, it's crucial to fine-tune your 
campaign user journey not just to attract traffic but to convert it into sales.  So...

- Focus on implementing last-minute checks to optimize your site for success.
- Remember, avoid attempting to increase the Average Order Value (AOV) 
during checkout, as it could distract customers. 
- Rely on a robust tech stack, especially [a competent analytics tool](/en/), which is 
vital throughout the campaign for preparation, tackling issues in real-time, 
re-engaging users, and gathering insights for future improvements.

Now you are ready to thrive, good luck on this crazy peak season!
