## 1 What is the conversion?

The eCommerce landscape in 2023 is evolving rapidly, driven by recent global events, such as the pandemic. Online shopping has become an integral part of our daily lives, and eCommerce trends are shaping this dynamic environment:

1. **Omnichannel Shopping:** Consumers now demand seamless experiences across various platforms.
2. **Personalization and AI:** AI-driven personalization is a standard practice.
3. **Mobile Commerce:** Mobile shopping is the new norm.
4. **Sustainability:** Eco-conscious shopping is on the rise.
5. **Fast Shipping:** Quick and reliable delivery options are expected.
6. **AR and VR:** These technologies enhance the shopping experience.
7. **Data Security:** Protecting customer data is a top priority.

Given this eCommerce landscape, understanding and optimizing conversions is more crucial than ever for eCommerce businesses.

### What is a Conversion?

In the digital realm, a conversion occurs when a visitor to your website completes a specific action, such as filling out a form, making a purchase, or subscribing to a service. The proportion of visitors who successfully convert is known as your "conversion rate." These conversions can include:

1. **Online Sales:** When a visitor makes a purchase, it's a direct and significant success for eCommerce businesses.
2. **Lead Generation:** Conversions also involve visitors expressing interest by providing contact information, turning them into potential customers.
3. **Email Signups:** Encouraging visitors to subscribe to your email list fosters ongoing engagement.
4. **Form Completions:** Filling out forms, whether for inquiries or sign-ups, is considered a valuable conversion for lead generation.

### Why Conversions Matter

Conversions are vital metrics in the marketing funnel. They measure how effectively your website and marketing strategies engage users at various stages of their journey, showing progress down the sales funnel.

Conversions help identify visitors genuinely interested in your products or services, enabling you to differentiate them from less interested users. They also serve as diagnostic tools, revealing issues in website design or marketing funnels, allowing for strategic refinements.

### Micro and Macro Conversions: A CRO Perspective

Understanding the user journey is crucial for differentiating between micro and macro conversions in the digital eCommerce landscape.

**Macro Conversions:** These are high-impact conversions aligned with your website's core objectives, such as making a purchase or booking a service. Tracking macro conversions is essential for assessing the overall effectiveness of your CRO strategy.

For instance, in an online clothing store, a macro conversion occurs when a user completes a purchase, contributing to revenue and customer acquisition.

**Micro Conversions:** These are smaller, incremental actions, like signing up for a newsletter, adding items to a cart, or viewing product details. It is an action or a set of actions that strongly indicate a user is progressing towards profitable action on your website. ****They indicate engagement and interest, providing insights into user behavior and progress toward the ultimate conversion. 

Analyzing these actions helps identify areas where users show interest and what steps lead them closer to the ultimate goal.

For example, a user browsing an online clothing store might view product pages, add items to their cart, and sign up for the newsletter. These are all micro conversions, indicating their interest and potential intent to make a purchase.

Recognizing the difference between micro and macro conversions and understanding their role in the user journey enables informed decisions for website optimization, improving the user experience. This, in turn, increases the likelihood of users progressing from micro to macro conversions, driving the success of your CRO strategy.

## 2 What is the conversion rate & How to calculate it

### Understanding Conversion Rates in eCommerce

In our previous discussion (what is conversion), we emphasized the critical role of conversions in the eCommerce landscape. Now, we'll take a deeper dive into the world of conversion rates, establishing connections with our earlier content, providing insights on how to calculate them, and highlighting the distinctions between global conversion rates and process-specific conversion rates.

### Linking Conversion Rates to Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)

As previously outlined, a conversion rate serves as a fundamental metric, gauging the proportion of website visitors who successfully accomplish a desired action, such as making a purchase, submitting a form, or subscribing to a service. This metric is pivotal in the realm of Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO), reflecting the efficacy of strategies aimed at engaging users and shepherding them through the sales funnel.

**Calculating Conversion Rates: A Simple Formula**

To calculate a conversion rate, the following formula proves invaluable:

**Conversion Rate (%)** = (Number of Conversions / Total Visitors) x 100
![](/blog/cro-for-beginners/conversionRateCaluculation.png)

For instance, consider a scenario where your eCommerce website witnessed 1,000 visitors, and 50 of them completed a purchase. Your resulting conversion rate would be:

**(50 / 1,000) x 100 = 5%**

This percentage reveals how proficiently your website transforms visitors into customers or achieves other intended actions.

### Global Conversion Rate vs. Process-Specific Conversion Rates

1. **Global Conversion Rate:** This metric offers a comprehensive overview, evaluating the overall conversion rate for your entire website. It measures the website's effectiveness in converting visitors into customers or achieving specific actions across all processes and pages. This high-level metric provides valuable insight into your website's performance in engaging and converting users.
2. **Process-Specific Conversion Rates:** In contrast, process-specific conversion rates focus on distinct actions or processes within your website. These can encompass:
    - **Checkout Conversion Rate:** This metric quantifies the percentage of users who successfully complete the checkout process and finalize a purchase. It is an indispensable gauge of your checkout experience's effectiveness.
    - **Cart Conversion Rate:** This rate tracks the percentage of visitors who add items to their cart. It plays a pivotal role in assessing how efficiently your website encourages users to take this crucial step.
    - **Account Creation Conversion Rate:** This metric measures the percentage of visitors who create an account on your platform. It is vital for evaluating user engagement and lead generation.

### Why Distinguish Between Global and Process-Specific Rates?

The distinction between global and process-specific conversion rates is paramount for targeted optimization, yielding the following advantages:

- **Diagnostic Insights:** Process-specific rates illuminate areas necessitating enhancement. For instance, if your cart conversion rate is lower than expected, it signifies issues within the cart experience that warrant attention.
- **Tailored Strategies:** Differently tailored strategies can be designed to enhance diverse processes. For example, if your account creation rate is underperforming, strategies like optimizing the registration form or offering incentives can be devised.
- **Holistic Performance Evaluation:** The global conversion rate offers an all-encompassing view of your website's performance, while process-specific rates enable an in-depth analysis of specific areas. This multifaceted approach ensures a well-rounded Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) strategy.

By competently employing both global and process-specific conversion rates, eCommerce teams can comprehensively optimize their websites, thereby augmenting their odds of success in the fiercely competitive eCommerce landscape of 2023.

This article bridges the gap between our previous discourse on conversions and the intricacies of conversion rates in eCommerce, delivering a more comprehensive understanding of these pivotal metrics.

## 3 What is conversion rate optimization

**CRO: a timeless strategy that's always been**

In a previous chapter of my life, I worked at a Big Retailer warehouse. It was a time when I'm almost certain WhatsApp didn't exist, but Facebook was already on the scene.

When I started working there, my boss explained how things operated. The phrase that stuck with me was, "Here, information flows from the bottom up. Any idea or improvement proposal should originate from the people at the base, not from top management.”

That got me excited. So much so that I carried a notebook with me every day, jotting down ideas on how to optimize processes. Most of them were either trivial or had already been tried and tested, but a few of them actually worked.

As time went on, my passion for this way of working led to me being entrusted with the mission of evangelizing this methodology (based on Toyota's Lean manufacturing) within any company I worked in. 

I share this because Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) is neither new nor magic nor the latest marketing trend. It's something that has been practiced for many years in the offline world.

Consider a restaurant strategically placing its most popular dishes at the top of the menu to boost orders. Or a retail store arranging products strategically to encourage more sales of certain items. These are real-world instances of CRO at work, where businesses refine their processes to enhance outcomes.

Forward-thinking companies, aware of the value it brings, have integrated CRO into all their processes. Take the big retail company I worked for, for example, which cultivates a culture of optimization in product development, logistics, sales, and throughout the entire organization.

Now, let's simplify CRO. Conversion Rate Optimization, or CRO, is like tuning your car for better mileage. It involves strategic adjustments to your website, much like a mechanic fine-tunes a car's engine. The goal is to increase the number of visitors who take a desired action on your site, whether that's making a purchase or signing up for a newsletter. CRO's aim is to maximize your website's performance, converting more visitors into satisfied customers.

So, when will you adopt this approach to elevate your results in the world of CRO?
