## 1 What is the conversion?
![](/en/guides/cro-for-beginners/whatIsConversion.png)

The eCommerce landscape in 2023 is evolving rapidly, driven by recent global events, such as the pandemic. Online shopping has become an integral part of our daily lives, and eCommerce trends are shaping this dynamic environment:

1. **Omnichannel Shopping:** Consumers now demand seamless experiences across various platforms.
2. **Personalization and AI:** AI-driven personalization is a standard practice.
3. **Mobile Commerce:** Mobile shopping is the new norm.
4. **Sustainability:** Eco-conscious shopping is on the rise.
5. **Fast Shipping:** Quick and reliable delivery options are expected.
6. **AR and VR:** These technologies enhance the shopping experience.
7. **Data Security:** Protecting customer data is a top priority.

Given this eCommerce landscape, understanding and optimizing conversions is more crucial than ever for eCommerce businesses.

### What is a Conversion?
![](/en/guides/cro-for-beginners/whatIsConversion2.png)

In the digital realm, a conversion occurs when a visitor to your website completes a specific action, such as filling out a form, making a purchase, or subscribing to a service. The proportion of visitors who successfully convert is known as your "conversion rate." These conversions can include:

1. **Online Sales:** When a visitor makes a purchase, it's a direct and significant success for eCommerce businesses.
2. **Lead Generation:** Conversions also involve visitors expressing interest by providing contact information, turning them into potential customers.
3. **Email Signups:** Encouraging visitors to subscribe to your email list fosters ongoing engagement.
4. **Form Completions:** Filling out forms, whether for inquiries or sign-ups, is considered a valuable conversion for lead generation.

### Why Conversions Matter

Conversions are vital metrics in the marketing funnel. They measure how effectively your website and marketing strategies engage users at various stages of their journey, showing progress down the sales funnel.

Conversions help identify visitors genuinely interested in your products or services, enabling you to differentiate them from less interested users. They also serve as diagnostic tools, revealing issues in website design or marketing funnels, allowing for strategic refinements.

### Micro and Macro Conversions: A CRO Perspective

Understanding the user journey is crucial for differentiating between micro and macro conversions in the digital eCommerce landscape.

**Macro Conversions:** These are high-impact conversions aligned with your website's core objectives, such as making a purchase or booking a service. Tracking macro conversions is essential for assessing the overall effectiveness of your [CRO strategy.](/en/blog/3-steps-cro-process-for-exponential-business-growth/)

For instance, in an online clothing store, a macro conversion occurs when a user completes a purchase, contributing to revenue and customer acquisition.

**Micro Conversions:** These are smaller, incremental actions, like signing up for a newsletter, adding items to a [cart](/en/blog/how-to-reduce-annoying-checkout-form-fills/), or viewing product details. It is an action or a set of actions that strongly indicate a user is progressing towards profitable action on your website. ****They indicate engagement and interest, providing insights into user behavior and progress toward the ultimate conversion. 

Analyzing these actions helps identify areas where users show interest and what steps lead them closer to the ultimate goal.

For example, a user browsing an online clothing store might view product pages, add items to their cart, and sign up for the newsletter. These are all micro conversions, indicating their interest and potential intent to make a purchase.

Recognizing the difference between micro and macro conversions and understanding their role in the user journey enables informed decisions for website optimization, improving the user experience. This, in turn, increases the likelihood of users progressing from micro to macro conversions, driving the success of your CRO strategy.

## 2 What is the conversion rate & How to calculate it

### Understanding Conversion Rates in eCommerce

In our previous discussion (what is conversion), we emphasized the critical role of conversions in the eCommerce landscape. Now, we'll take a deeper dive into the world of conversion rates, establishing connections with our earlier content, providing insights on how to calculate them, and highlighting the distinctions between global conversion rates and process-specific conversion rates.

### Linking Conversion Rates to Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)

As previously outlined, a conversion rate serves as a fundamental metric, gauging the proportion of website visitors who successfully accomplish a desired action, such as making a purchase, submitting a form, or subscribing to a service. This metric is pivotal in the realm of [Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)](/en/blog/8-ways-to-optimize-your-ecommerce-conversion-rate/), reflecting the efficacy of strategies aimed at engaging users and shepherding them through the sales funnel.

**Calculating Conversion Rates: A Simple Formula**

To calculate a conversion rate, the following formula proves invaluable:

**Conversion Rate (%)** = (Number of Conversions / Total Visitors) x 100
![](/en/guides/cro-for-beginners/conversionRateCaluculation.png)

For instance, consider a scenario where your eCommerce website witnessed 1,000 visitors, and 50 of them completed a purchase. Your resulting conversion rate would be:

**(50 / 1,000) x 100 = 5%**

This percentage reveals how proficiently your website transforms visitors into customers or achieves other intended actions.

### Global Conversion Rate vs. Process-Specific Conversion Rates

1. **Global Conversion Rate:** This metric offers a comprehensive overview, evaluating the overall conversion rate for your entire website. It measures the website's effectiveness in converting visitors into customers or achieving specific actions across all processes and pages. This high-level metric provides valuable insight into your website's performance in engaging and converting users.
2. **Process-Specific Conversion Rates:** In contrast, process-specific conversion rates focus on distinct actions or processes within your website. These can encompass:
    - **[Checkout Conversion Rate](https://www.air360.io/en/blog/maximizing-conversion-rates-and-enhancing-ux/):** This metric quantifies the percentage of users who successfully complete the checkout process and finalize a purchase. It is an indispensable gauge of your checkout experience's effectiveness.
    - **Cart Conversion Rate:** This rate tracks the percentage of visitors who add items to their cart. It plays a pivotal role in assessing how efficiently your website encourages users to take this crucial step.
    - **Account Creation Conversion Rate:** This metric measures the percentage of visitors who create an account on your platform. It is vital for evaluating user engagement and lead generation.

### Why Distinguish Between Global and Process-Specific Rates?

The distinction between global and process-specific conversion rates is paramount for targeted optimization, yielding the following advantages:

- **Diagnostic Insights:** Process-specific rates illuminate areas necessitating enhancement. For instance, if your cart conversion rate is lower than expected, it signifies issues within the cart experience that warrant attention.
- **Tailored Strategies:** Differently tailored strategies can be designed to enhance diverse processes. For example, if your account creation rate is underperforming, strategies like optimizing the registration form or offering incentives can be devised.
- **Holistic Performance Evaluation:** The global conversion rate offers an all-encompassing view of your website's performance, while process-specific rates enable an in-depth analysis of specific areas. This multifaceted approach ensures a well-rounded Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) strategy.

By competently employing both global and process-specific conversion rates, eCommerce teams can comprehensively optimize their websites, thereby augmenting their odds of success in the fiercely competitive eCommerce landscape of 2023.

## 3 What is conversion rate optimization 
![](/en/guides/cro-for-beginners/whatIsCRO.png)

**CRO: a timeless strategy that's always been**

In a previous chapter of my life, I worked at a Big Retailer warehouse. It was a time when I'm almost certain WhatsApp didn't exist, but Facebook was already on the scene.

When I started working there, my boss explained how things operated. The phrase that stuck with me was, "Here, information flows from the bottom up. Any idea or improvement proposal should originate from the people at the base, not from top management.”

That got me excited. So much so that I carried a notebook with me every day, jotting down ideas on how to optimize processes. Most of them were either trivial or had already been tried and tested, but a few of them actually worked.

As time went on, my passion for this way of working led to me being entrusted with the mission of evangelizing this methodology (based on Toyota's Lean manufacturing) within any company I worked in. 

I share this because [Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)](https://www.air360.io/en/blog/3-steps-cro-process-for-exponential-business-growth/) is neither new nor magic nor the latest marketing trend. It's something that has been practiced for many years in the offline world.

Consider a restaurant strategically placing its most popular dishes at the top of the menu to boost orders. Or a retail store arranging products strategically to encourage more sales of certain items. These are real-world instances of CRO at work, where businesses refine their processes to enhance outcomes.

![](/en/guides/cro-for-beginners/man.jpg)

Forward-thinking companies, aware of the value it brings, have integrated CRO into all their processes. Take the big retail company I worked for, for example, which cultivates a culture of optimization in product development, logistics, sales, and throughout the entire organization.

Now, let's simplify CRO. Conversion Rate Optimization, or CRO, is like tuning your car for better mileage. It involves strategic adjustments to your website, much like a mechanic fine-tunes a car's engine. The goal is to increase the number of visitors who take a desired action on your site, whether that's making a purchase or signing up for a newsletter. CRO's aim is to maximize your website's performance, converting more visitors into satisfied customers.

So, when will you adopt this approach to elevate your results in the world of CRO?

## 6 What is CRO for e-commerce
![](/en/guides/cro-for-beginners/croForEcommerce.png)
If you're involved in the world of e-commerce, you've probably heard of CRO, but the exact definition can be a bit fuzzy. According to Wikipedia, Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) is about increasing the percentage of website visitors who become customers or perform any desired action on a web page. However, this definition may not fully capture the essence of CRO.

In the world of e-commerce, CRO goes beyond simply increasing the conversion rate. It's a strategic process that aims to improve efficiency, profitability, and the overall success of an online business. Here, we'll delve into what CRO means in the context of e-commerce and how it can drive your online success.

### E-commerce CRO: More Than Conversion Rates

[E-commerce CRO](/en/blog/3-steps-cro-process-for-exponential-business-growth/) is about maximizing profitability through efficiency. It's not a one-time fix, opinion-based, or about copying competitors blindly. It's a data-driven, strategic journey.

### The Role of Segmentation in E-commerce CRO

Segmentation is a cornerstone of successful e-commerce CRO. It involves categorizing your audience into distinct groups based on characteristics, behaviors, or preferences. By tailoring CRO efforts to these segments, you enhance efficiency and effectiveness.

### E-commerce CRO Methodology

Implementing e-commerce CRO follows a four-phase methodology:

1. **Research:** Gather data to understand user behavior, weaknesses, and improvement opportunities.
2. **Hypotheses:** Formulate hypotheses based on research to address deficiencies in different segments.
3. **Testing:** Test hypotheses through controlled experiments to identify impactful actions.
4. **Results:** Analyze test results and make data-driven decisions to implement changes.

### Ideal Conversion Rate for eCommerce

Determining an ideal conversion rate is nuanced and influenced by industry, product type, website design, and audience. On average, e-commerce sees rates of [2.5% to 3%](https://marketing.dynamicyield.com/benchmarks/conversion-rate/).

Improving global conversion rates in e-commerce requires focusing on micro conversions, which are key stages in a customer's journey. Enhancing these can boost your overall conversion rate.

### Global Conversion Enhancement

Defining the right conversion rate for your e-commerce business requires careful evaluation. Continuous monitoring and optimization are key for sustained success.

To boost your global conversion rate in the intricate landscape of e-commerce, focus on optimizing various micro conversions:

1. **Product Page Views to Add to Cart:** Showcases early interest in products.
2. **[Add to Cart to Initiate Checkout:](/en/blog/maximizing-conversion-rates-and-enhancing-ux/)** Indicates strong purchase intent.
3. **Initiate Checkout to Complete Purchase:** Converts visitors to customers.
4. **Newsletter Sign-ups:** Nurtures leads through email marketing.
5. **Account Registrations:** Enhances personalization and repeat purchases.
6. **Cross-sell and Upsell Conversions:** Increases order value.
7. **Product Review Submissions:** Builds trust and social proof.
8. **Social Media Engagement:** Boosts brand visibility and loyalty.
9. **Wishlist Creations:** Shows strong product interest.
10. **Referral Program Participation:** Drives brand growth.
11. **Customer Account Updates:** Reflects an ongoing relationship.

## 7 What is conversion rate optimization in digital marketing?
![](/en/guides/cro-for-beginners/understandCro.png)
### Understanding CRO in Digital Marketing

Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) is the secret sauce that can significantly boost your eCommerce strategy. It's the fine art of turning your website visitors into customers, and it plays a pivotal role in the world of digital marketing. But what exactly is CRO, and how does it work? Let's break it down.

In the ever-evolving landscape of digital marketing, one term frequently thrown around is "user acquisition." it is the initial step in engaging potential customers. It's the moment when a visitor transitions into a potential lead or user, which is a critical juncture in the customer journey. This is precisely where Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) comes into play and why it is exceptionally vital for optimizing the acquisition process.

### The Role of Acquisition CRO

[Acquisition CRO](/en/blog/investing-in-paid-media-vs-investing-in-cro/) focuses on optimizing the initial stages of your customer's journey. It's about making sure that when people land on your website, they not only stay but also take meaningful actions. This can include downloading an app, signing up for an account, or making that all-important first purchase.

Now, let's delve into the heart of the matter: **What is conversion in marketing?**
### Defining Conversion in Marketing

Conversion in marketing occurs when a user takes a desired action in response to a Call to Action (CTA). These CTAs can be embedded in ads, offers, or push notifications. The action taken may vary, depending on your campaign objectives. For example, in the mobile marketing world, conversions can be a download, app installation, sign-up, or a purchase, among other actions.

### Why is Conversion Important to Marketers?

Conversion is the compass that guides marketers in their digital wilderness. Here's why it's crucial:

*Measuring Campaign Performance:* Conversion rates are key performance indicators (KPIs) that help assess the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. Without tracking conversions, it's challenging to determine your return on ad spend (ROAS) or gauge the success of your efforts.

*Tailoring Campaigns for Success:* When running  user acquisition campaigns, conversion rates provide a vital yardstick. They reveal how successful each campaign is and can be used to set return on investment (ROI) expectations when scaling up.

*Aligning with Company Goals:* Not all conversions are created equal. While a high conversion rate for new accounts or app installs is a great start, the ultimate goal might be generating revenue through purchases. You gain a holistic view of your user's journey by considering multiple conversion events.


### Beyond the Basics: Other Uses of Conversion Rates

Conversion rates offer more than just campaign evaluation:

*Comparing Advertising Channels:* They allow you to compare and contrast the performance of various advertising channels. This data can be invaluable for [optimizing your marketing strategy.](/en/blog/10-ways-to-reduce-customer-acquisition-costs/)

*User Segmentation and Targeting:* By analyzing conversion events further down the funnel, you can identify valuable user segments. This information can enhance the targeting and segmentation of your campaigns.

*Enhancing User Experience (UX):* A lower-than-expected conversion rate may indicate issues with your web/app  user experience. It serves as a spotlight on areas for improvement, such as sign-in problems or other UX hurdles.

*Testing Development Changes:* When development changes are implemented, conversion rates can be a litmus test for success. For instance, if you overhaul the onboarding process and see a significant improvement in conversions, it suggests that onboarding plays a critical role in the customer journey.

In conclusion, CRO and conversion in marketing are essential tools for eCommerce success. By optimizing your website or app to enhance the user experience and tracking conversions, you can increase your ROI and guide your digital marketing strategy to new heights.

## 8 Acquisition vs CRO
![](/en/guides/cro-for-beginners/acquisitionVsCro.png)
For many years, businesses have been focusing a significant proportion of their marketing budgets on acquisition, under the pretence that more traffic will naturally lead to increased sales or revenue, which should, in turn, lead to business growth.

But it’s not always that simple.

### Let’s start by looking at acquisition activities.

For an acquisition campaign to be considered a success, it needs to generate revenue. The traffic generated by your acquisition activities could be created organically, or it could be part of a paid-spend campaign. If you are investing money into attracting website traffic, you need to feel confident that you will receive a return on your investment. This could be an immediate return, such as the purchase of a product via your online shop, or it could be a longer-term return on your investment, such as building a relationship with a potential client.

If your sole focus is on acquisition, then a key part of your work will be based on improving your search engine rankings, improving organic traffic, and enhancing the online visibility of your business. But that’s where the work stops. Once the visitors have landed on your website, the task of converting them into paying customers moves elsewhere.

### How are acquisition and CRO connected?

In our experience, too many businesses fail to see the connection between the two activities.

We believe that while it's vital to generate traffic and entice people to visit your website, it’s just as important to convert those visitors into paying customers. And beyond that, it’s important to make sure that any conversions align with your wider business strategy. This is the most effective way to ensure that you are maximizing the impact of any increased revenue.

This is why we think it’s important to take a holistic approach to any digital marketing activities. Acquisition and CRO should not be managed in siloes. Instead, they should be carefully connected and thought through as part of your wider digital strategy. By considering them as a complementary duo, you’ll be better prepared to take advantage of new opportunities or react to changing environments.

What’s more, it can also be far more cost-effective.

Let’s explain more.

#### Taking an acquisition-first approach

If you focus solely on your search engine KPIs, then you may start to pay too much attention to the technical aspects of [acquisition](/en/blog/10-ways-to-reduce-customer-acquisition-costs/), namely technical SEO. It can be easy to become focused upon these metrics without understanding their wider implications.

For example, we know that websites need to have a mobile-first approach to design and build. This is because consumers are increasingly using their phones and/or tablets to browse and shop online. An SEO team may recommend that you make minor changes to a page to improve its visibility on mobile to improve the search engine performance. Your SEO team could suggest reducing the number of images in a bid to improve site speed.

However, because their sole focus is upon the technicalities of SEO, they may not have to consider whether those changes could hurt that page's conversion rate.

The result could be that while that particular page ranks better organically, the conversion rates drop. As a result, your business may need to invest more in paid-spending activities to make up for the lower conversion rate.

#### Taking a CRO-first approach

Similarly, taking a CRO-first approach to your website means that too much attention is focused upon improving the conversion rate, without understanding how that could impact the wider SEO implications.

You may look at your website page and feel that visually it could benefit from a refresh. Perhaps your customer analytics are telling you that visitors are not reading lengthy product descriptions. Instead, they simply want to view individual product photos before making a purchasing decision. From a CRO perspective, you could recommend reducing the written content and increasing the number of images. However, that content may have been heavily optimized to attract organic traffic. By removing the content, you may have increased the conversion rate. You may also have inadvertently prevented any new customers from finding that particular page because the changes cause the page to fall down the search engine page rankings.

The result, like the acquisition-first approach, could mean that you have to spend far more on paid activities than you need to. This is because you’ll need to use paid-spend options to increase that page’s visibility within search engines.

#### What are the benefits of considering acquisition and CRO at the same time?

It is clear that by taking careful consideration of both acquisition and CRO activities at the same time, you could find that you have a far more cost-effective digital marketing strategy.

We believe that by considering them a partnership and ensuring collaborative working between different teams or departments, you’ll yield far more effective results. This can, in turn, provide you with a superior return on your investment.

There are so many elements of a good acquisition campaign that are intrinsic parts of conversion optimization that it’s a no-brainer that the two activities should be carefully combined. A core part of your CRO strategy is to ensure that the UX is carefully thought through. This can include the page layout, the overall visual image, the site speeds, etc – all of which are hugely relevant for SEO tactics. The better optimized the page, the easier it is to attract the right organic traffic that intends to convert to a paying customer.

#### Are your acquisition and CRO activities aligned with your broader business strategy?

One final element that is often missing from both acquisition and CRO campaigns is having an innate understanding of what your wider business strategy is.

In an ideal scenario, your newly combined acquisition and CRO activities will increase traffic to a particular page. [Conversions](/en/blog/8-ways-to-optimize-your-ecommerce-conversion-rate/) will be quick and easy because you’ve used all of your available data metrics to understand what the visitor is looking for and what they expect to find on your site. You’ve put everything in place, but it may still not necessarily lead to increased revenue.

This is because you need to be clear about your wider business performance.

If you’re a retailer with an online store, have you focused your attention on the products that provide you with greater margins? To increase your revenue, you need to factor in how much you are spending on acquisition or CRO activities with the manufacturing/production costs of that specific product. The higher the profit margin, the better the revenue generated.

If we come back to the theme of collaborative working, you should ensure that your marketing and acquisition teams are working closely with your sales teams. This way, you can prioritize your most important products or services. By focusing on your best-sellers first and foremost, you can quickly and effectively improve your revenue and create an effective return on your investment.

For the past 5 years, we have worked with big DTC brands,and although CRO  back in the day was not as widespread as it is right now, we still face today the same objection from marketers we had to deal with in the very beginning:

"My business is doing okay. Investing in traffic acquisition works for us. Why rock the boat with that CRO thing?"

Don't get us wrong, we do understand why you might be reluctant.

Why fix it if it ain't broke, right?

But is accepting the status quo the right call? Why would you be content with "good enough" KPIs when you could get more revenue out of your marketing budget? Instead of apprehending the unknown, you should fear missing out on the extra revenue that's spilling through your fingers.

There is but one valid reason to ignore CRO: Marketers have lots of reasons why they discard CRO. Most of them are utter nonsense. Let's see:

1. **I don't know what it is:** While ignorance is no excuse (marketers usually stay on top of major digital trends), this is easily remedied by defining CRO and how it could benefit your business (in fact we will do just that in a minute).
2. **I can't afford it:** If you spend some of your marketing budget acquiring traffic, then chances are you can afford it; and investing part of that budget into CRO might bring in a bigger ROI (but more on that later).
3. **I don't have time:** We're all busy. We all have to set priorities and focus on what we think will move the needle faster; but before you put CRO in the "low priority" tier (aka. the "I'll never get around to that" category), you should assess the actual ROI potential (and not just discard it based on your gut feeling).
4. **I don't have the required skill-set:** We can't be good at everything; in fact, we are completely useless at a lot of things. But guess what: you can always hire people who have mastered the skills you need.
5. **I don't think that's worth it:** You have assessed the potential ROI of CRO for your business and found it's not worth the investment. This is definitely a valid reason - THE one and only valid reason - but only if you ran the numbers and assessed the ROI potential ( We will show you how in a bit).

If you have reached this point in the article, then you can't just stop and fall back on the aforementioned excuses to ignore CRO. Now you just have to keep reading to know how to run the numbers and figure out whether or not CRO is a good option for your business.

Above all else, you shouldn't settle for less revenue just because it's easy. Don't ignore the cost of missing out on CRO as it could be huge.

Let's get to it.

### How does CRO work?

CRO is a process that relies heavily on two pillars:

The first is A LOT of research - it is a learning process that brings you closer to your audience; obviously the more you know about your visitors, and their interactions, the more you understand them; and the more you understand them, the better you are able to identify what could potentially generate a conversion increase.

The second is A/B testing - which is the process of creating another version of a page (based on the research you conducted) and splitting your traffic between both page variations. Then you compare their respective conversion rates and permanently implement the highest performer.

Successful optimizers spend most of their time doing research, not working on A/B tests. So if you end up working on CRO yourself, make sure you don’t jump into A/B testing without doing prior research.

I am telling you this because A/B testing solutions tend to market their products as one-stop shops for CRO. But if you are serious about getting actual results, don’t skip on research and instead start by diving into Google Analytics, surveys, user tests, and so on. That's the road to success, the path to higher conversion rates.

**Two valid, complementary approaches to revenue growth**

You have two options to choose from when it comes to increasing sales:

- Either you spend money on acquiring more traffic (and keep converting that traffic at the same level)
- Or you invest in CRO to convert more of your visitors into customers (without bringing in additional traffic)

Most businesses invest in traffic acquisition as a matter of course. The question becomes: should you use part of your acquisition budget on CRO instead?

**Doubling down on acquisition vs. investing in CRO**

Let’s compare both options by taking a simple example. Let's say you currently get 10,000 visitors a month (and your acquisition cost is $0.5 per visitor); you convert 2% of this traffic on average, which represents 200 transactions a month. You sell 1 product that costs $50 (it is meant as a simple example after all!) so your monthly turnover is $10,000.

- 10,000 visitors X 2% conversion rate = 200 transactions / month
- 200 transactions X $50 = $10,000 / month

Let’s say you wish to increase your sales by 50% and get from $10,000 to $15,000 monthly turnover. You have two options:

1. You get 50% more traffic: you spend $2,500 on acquiring new traffic.
2. You increase your conversion rate by 50%: you convert at 3% instead of 2%.

### More acquisition VS. Acquisition + CRO

Assuming you are a rational person, in a perfect world, you would choose whichever option is the most cost-effective, which means you would invest in CRO only if it costs less than $2,500 to get a +50% conversion boost.

We are not, however, in a perfect world, and it is not possible to predict by how much you'll be able to improve your conversion rate if you spend $$2,500 on CRO (either in time spent or money).

Even though the investment required to achieve the same result with CRO is usually bigger than through pure acquisition over the course of a month, I would still recommend you pick CRO in most cases (unless your cost of acquisition is very low).

Why? Because any conversion increase created during that month will last for a long time, whereas you would need to spend an extra $2,500 every month to keep selling 50% more products.

So even if you are not ROI-positive after one month, it will definitely pay off in time. You will be able to get a higher monthly turnover without having to spend more money on acquiring traffic every month.

**Time to run the numbers!**

It's time for you to do the math and weigh both options so you know which would be the most cost-effective to generate sustainable growth for your business.
