## Software Should Be Simple to Use  
We believe in well-designed software, built with passion, that is enjoyable and easy to use. 
We’re constantly looking for ways to remove, not add. Less is more.  

## Customer Success Is the New Marketing  
Most of our customers come through referrals from other customers.
We love to practice what Tony Hsieh did at Zappos: customer service is the new marketing. 
Why spend money on advertising when your customers can do it for you?  

We like to spend as much time as possible with our customers—surprising them, empathizing with them. 
We approach every business relationship as if it will last forever.  

Spending tons of money on PR while your product doesn’t hold up to expectations is a mistake.  

## Small Is Beautiful  
We believe that the best things can’t happen when there are too many people at the table. 
We hire passionate people who deeply care about what they’re doing. Nothing beats passion. 
Finding and hiring passionate people is not a money problem.  

While we aim to put Air360 in the hands of as many people as possible, scaling should be a byproduct of our success, not a goal in itself.
Many companies have ego-driven metrics such as “headcount.” 
We do not believe that this should be a metric of success.  

## Funding  
Taking investors’ money and spending it like there’s no tomorrow is quite common in our industry.
We're happy that Air360 lives from the money from its customers and enjoys an organic (yet fast) growth.

We have the freedom to execute on our long term vision while keeping our energy on solving our customers challenges.

Not being funded reminds us everyday that our customers are the ones putting food on our table.
This helps us keep our priorities straight and is the core of all our decisions at all times.

## Be Real and Long Term  
Many companies chase the spotlight with “revolutionizing AI”-filled press releases everywhere.
Of course, this often comes with big rounds of funding and rapidly increasing “headcounts.” 
While we respect this approach, it is not our game.
We want to play a different one.  

## Humble, Yet Confident  
We’re in a fast-evolving environment. What we knew yesterday might not be true today. 
Being complacent about our experience or product would put us in trouble. 
Ego can destroy a company faster than you might think.  

Humility is not a lack of confidence. Quite the opposite—it shows confidence in our ability to execute and adapt to change. 
Staying humble is what keeps us listening to our customers and ensures we remain relevant in the future.
