## Software should be simple to use-

We believe in well designed software built with passion that is enjoyable and easy to use.
We’re constantly looking for ways to remove, not add. Less is more.

## Customer success is the new marketing-

Most of our customers come referred by other customers.
We love to practice what Tony Hsieh did at Zappos: Customer service is the new marketing.
Why spend money on advertising when customers can do this for you?
We like to spend as much time as possible with our customers. Surprise them, empathize with them.
We like to start our business relationship as they would last forever.

Spending tons of money on PR while your product doesn’t holds up to expectations

## Small is beautiful-

We believe that the best things can’t happen when you have too many people around the table.
We hire passionate people who deeply care about what they’re doing. Nothing beats passion.
Finding and hiring passionate is not a money problem.

While we aim to put Air360 in the hands of as many people as possible, scaling should be a byproduct of our success, not a goal in itself.
Many companies have ego-driven metrics such as “headcount”.
We do not believe that this should be a metric of success.

## Funding-

Taking investors money and spending it like there’s no tomorrow is easier and more common than what you might be thinking.
Anyone can do this, really. Creating a product that solves a real problem (effectively) with a sustainable business model is already harder.

We believe all these do not come for free. Money hungry people come and greed takes over.
When decisions are made, they often lose sight of what’s truly important: your customer.
And most importantly, how do your solve their problems?

This reminds our team that customers are the ones paying our keyboards (which we love) or putting food on our family’s table.
This is at the core of all our decisions at all times.

## Be real and long term-

Many companies chase the spotlight with “revolutionizing AI” filled press releases everywhere.
Of course, this often goes with big rounds of funding and fast increasing “headcounts”.
While we do respect these, this is not our game. We want to play a different one.

## Confident, but humble-

We’re in a fast evolving environment.
What we knew yesterday might not be true today anymore.
Being complacent on our experience or product would put us in trouble.
Ego can destroy a company faster than you may think.

Humility is not lack of confidence. Quite the opposite.
We’re confident we can execute and adapt to change.
Staying humble is what keeps us listening to our customers and stay relevant in the future.
