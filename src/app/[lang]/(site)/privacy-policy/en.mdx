# Privacy Policy

Last updated：December 2024

## Preamble

This Privacy policy applies to the website www.air360.io.

Privacy of our clients, partners and suppliers as well as your privacy, as users of the 
website www.air360.io, is key for us. The purpose of this privacy policy is to provide you 
with information concerning how we collect Personal information when you use this 
website, how we use and process collected information; and choices you may have about 
the ways we collect, process and use that information. Our goal is not only to comply with 
applicable data protection and privacy laws (including the Regulation EU 2016/679 of 
April 27, 2016, also known as General Data Protection Regulation – GDPR), but also to 
minimize the process of that Personal information.

“Personal information” means in a nutshell information that identifies you personally, 
directly or indirectly, either alone or in combination with other information.

## Which information do you collect?

The Personal information we collect includes, but is not limited to, your name, email 
address, IP address, phone number and other information about you voluntarily 
submitted to verify who you are or to prevent fraud. If you contact us, we may collect 
additional Personal information which you knowingly and voluntarily provide through 
your contact with us.

We furthermore collect information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser, 
which may include, without limitation, information that does not identify you personally 
(such as the date and time of your visit). The information we receive in this manner 
depends on the settings on your web browser. If you have created a user identity on one 
of your visits to this website, we may link the information provided by your browser to 
information that identifies you personally and use it for the purposes described below. 
Please review the settings of your web browser if you want to learn what information 
your browser sends or how to change your settings.

## Cookies or not cookies
Consistent with our vision of data analytics and our desire to minimize the use of personal 
data, the air360.io site is cookie-free.

### Social Plugins

Our website may use social plugins (“plugins”) of some social networks such as Instagram, 
X (ex-Twitter) or LinkedIn.

These plugins can be recognized by their famous logos appearing on Air360.io website.
As soon as a web page is being accessed which contains such a plugin, your browser will 
establish a direct connection with the servers of the social media. The content of the 
plugin will usually be communicated directly from the relevant social media to your 
browser and embedded in the web page. We therefore have no influence on the amount 
of data the relevant social media obtains through these plugins.

We are not acquainted with the purpose and extent of the data collection as well as any 
further processing and use of the data by the relevant social media.

## What are my choices

We respect your right to make choices about the ways we collect and use Personal 
information about you. We generally ask you to indicate your choices at the time and on 
the page where you provide your personal information.

When you provide personal information, we may offer you a choice as to whether you 
would like to receive further communications from us and/or from our partners, such as 
communications related to updates, upgrades, special offers and pricing. You have the 
right to withdraw your consent at any time. If you decide you no longer want to receive 
promotional messages from us, you may let us know via the contact form on our website 
https://www.air360.io/ or by email at privacy@air360.io. Please specify which consent 
you are revoking in your email to us. Please note, however, if you give us permission to 
add your contact information to the Merchant’s mailing list and later withdraw your 
permission, you will have to contact the Merchant (or use the “opt-out” provided in the 
emails the Merchant sends you) to have your name removed from the Merchant’s mailing 
lists.

We may use third party service providers to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet, 
and sometimes on this website. Therefore, you may receive communications, including 
emails, from our partners but only if you have given your prior explicit consent. This 
consent can be revoked at any time by contacting us at privacy@air360.io or by using the 
unsubscribe link included in the communications.

In certain circumstances, where you do not provide Personal information, which is 
required, we will not be able to provide the services and the answer you or may not be 
able to comply with a legal obligation on us. We will make it clear if and when this situation
arises and what the consequences of not providing the Personal information would be.

## Privacy Notice to California Residents
If you are a resident of California, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits you to 
request information regarding the disclosure of your personal information by Air360, Inc. 
or its subsidiaries to a third party for the third party’s direct marketing purposes. This 
right granted to California residents applies only to their activities within the State of 
California. To make such a request, please click privacy@air360.io. In your request, please

## How do you secure my personal information?
We are committed to keeping personal information secure. We have implemented 
physical, technical and administrative safeguards reasonably designed to protect your 
Personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. When we collect or 
process Personal information, we use industry best standard methods to protect that 
information. It is important that you understand, however, that no website, database or 
system is completely secure or “hacker proof.” You are also responsible for taking 
reasonable steps to protect your personal information against unauthorized disclosure or 
misuse, for example, by protecting your password.

Different countries have different privacy laws and requirements. Please know, however, 
that no matter where your personal information is collected, used, transferred or stored, 
if it was collected through this website, it will be protected by us in accordance with the 
terms of this Privacy Policy and applicable laws, rules and regulations.

## Do we share your Personal Information?
No (except with some subcontractor with whom we have entered into a data processing 
agreement complying with the provision of the GDPR) unless required by law.

## Do we sell or market your Personal Information?
No.

## What are my rights?
You have certain rights in relation to your personal data. Some of these rights will only 
apply in certain circumstances. If an individual would like to exercise, or discuss, any of 
these rights, he should submit his request in writing or email to email and provide 
sufficient information to allow us to understand the scope of the request.

- Access: you are entitled to ask us if we are processing your personal data and, if we are,
you can request access to your personal data. This enables you to receive a copy of 
the personal data we hold about you and certain other information about it.
- Correction: you are entitled to request that any incomplete or inaccurate personal 
data we hold about you is corrected.
- Erasure: you are entitled to ask us to delete or remove personal data in certain 
circumstances. There are also certain exceptions where we may refuse a request 
for erasure, for example, where the personal data is required for compliance with 
law or in connection with claims.
- Restriction: you are entitled to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data, 
for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
- Transfer: you are entitled to request the transfer of your personal data to another 
third party in limited circumstances.
- Objection: when we process personal data based on legitimate interests (or those of a 
third party) you may challenge this. However, we may be entitled to continue 
processing personal data based on our compelling legitimate interests or where 
this is relevant to legal claims. You also have the right to object to processing 
personal data for direct marketing purposes.
- Automated decisions: you are entitled to contest any automated decision made about 
you where this has a legal or similarly significant effect and ask for it to be 
reconsidered.
- Supervisory Authority: you also have a right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory 
authority, in particular in the Member State in the European Union where you are 
habitually resident, where you work or where an alleged infringement of Data 
Protection Legislation has taken place.
- Determine guidelines as to the use of your personal data after your death: you have a 
right to determine guidelines as to the storage, erasure and communication of your 
personal data after your death. These guidelines may be general or specific.

## Transfers of personal information to outside of the European Union or in a country with equivalent protection
Your Personal information is not transferred outside the European Union or outside a 
country with equivalent protection (as Japan where Air360’s headquarter is located).

If your Personal information would be transferred to a party located in a country that 
does not provide for a level of data protection that is sufficient according to European 
Union standards, such transfer would be made on a data transfer agreement based on the 
standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, copies of which 
would be available on demand by sending an email to privacy@air360.io.
