Hey everyone-

I’m Flo, founder here at Air360.

Our team started Air360 in 2016 with the mission to make it incredibly easy for anyone to analyze visitor flow on their website.

For 98% of businesses, figuring out what’s going on their website is still a chore. And a challenging one. Yet it’s not for lack of trying. Digital teams, CRO teams, Product teams, work insanely hard to create the best possible experience for their visitors.

We believe your website has a single purpose: let your visitor achieve whatever he came to do with the least amount of time and effort. We believe your visitors and customers time is precious. You don’t get the chance twice to do a good first impression.

What keeps us awake at night is not our direct competitors but all the companies who are struggling with this. They’re leaving money on the table with wasted opportunities.

Helping these companies is what gets up in the morning. And we know this better be as simple, short, effective as possible.

It’s now 2025 and we’re still working hard toward this goal. We’ve come a long way but we believe we’ve only scratched the surface.

The best is yet to come.
