AI made a lot of progress recently.
Things got wilder since 2023, especially with the progress of LLMs (Large Language Models).

While we believe this could be helpful in many use cases at Air360, it’s also a technology that like any other, has its flaws.
It’s no magic.

Also, while LLM are great with generating text, they’re actually not that great when it comes to reasoning and data skills.

<mark>We believe that our business is about delivering data to make you take important decisions.
We take this very seriously. This can be just “about right” or “probably right”.</mark>

That is also why AI can be a nice co-pilot for software engineers but we believe it will never replace them unlike what many claim.
It actually makes us sad when young students give up on software engineering careers because they believe AI will replace them.
That is simply not true.

Actually few people know what they’re really talking about, but hey, it brings views, some spotlight and let’s face it, money.
Because the CEO of Nvidia says so doesn’t mean it’s true. First, these claims make great (and free) PR for Nvidia.
Then, Nvidia has an agenda to make companies use AI as they sell the hardware to do so.

The real experts who keep it real on A.I. like Luc Julia or Yann LeCun don’t make as much noise.
Yet, they give a much more accurate speech on the reality of artificial intelligence.

Yes LLMs can write a few lines of code, this is rather easy for a LLM.
However, it can’t reason, design, anticipate or show critical thinking.
Which is what 90% of what software engineers spend their time doing.
Software engineering is so much more than writing code.

Similarly, <mark>an AI won’t be able to figure out why people are giving up on your checkout funnel.
But it can help to point where there is a problem. This is where we are focusing our efforts.</mark>

So we often get asked “what’s your AI strategy?”.
While we’re exploring different ideas to see how this could benefit our customers.
We do not want to rush and engage in this race to create hype or attract “latest trend chasing” type of people.

We’ve been told “you need to be AI first” if you want to draw attention.
Well, you know what, we’re here for the long term.
Building and advertising a click-bait feature would be great for PR and short term results, probably.
However, we believe it’s also not a great way to build a long term business.
We do not want to build vaporware.

We’re here to build long term business.
Keeping it real is the best way to do this.
