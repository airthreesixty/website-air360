Hey everyone-

I’m Flo, founder here at Air360.

Our team started Air360 in 2016 with the mission to make it incredibly easy for anyone to analyze visitor flow on their website.

For 98% of businesses, figuring out what’s going on their website is still a chore. And a challenging one. Yet it’s not for lack of trying. Digital teams, CRO teams, Product teams, work insanely hard to create the best possible experience for their visitors.

Most analytics products are either complicated stacks, complicated (and costly) software that doesn’t deliver. We often hear it from prospects “We’ve been using XYZ, we had our hopes high, but we have failed to use it properly, our money and efforts went to waste”.

Powerful software is not enough. It should be also incredibly simple to use. No one enjoys complicated software. No one likes “checking dashboard” either.

The result? 98% of businesses throw the towel on it. Guesswork and beautiful designs replace actual observations. Resulting in good looking but ineffective websites.

We believe your website has a single purpose: let your visitor achieve whatever he came to do with the least amount of time and effort. We believe your visitors and customers time is precious. You don’t get the chance twice to do a good first impression.

What keeps us awake at night is not our direct competitors but all the companies who are struggling with this. They’re leaving money on the table with wasted opportunities. Remember how many times you tried to do something online and thought “whoever designed this seems they couldn’t care less!”. Or the last time you tried to purchase a product and couldn’t. Leaving the website with the feeling you wasted XX minutes of your life? Does that ring a bell?

Helping these companies is what gets up in the morning. And we know this better be as simple, short, effective as possible.

It’s now 2025 and we’re still working hard toward this goal. We’ve come a long way but we believe we’ve only scratched the surface.

The best is yet to come.
