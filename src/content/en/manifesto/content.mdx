Hey everyone,

I’m Flo, founder of Air360.

Our team started Air360 in 2016 with one mission: to make it incredibly easy for anyone to analyze visitor flow on their website.

For 98% of businesses, figuring out what’s happening on their website is still a chore—and a tough one at that. It’s not for lack of effort. Digital teams, CRO teams, and Product teams work tirelessly to create the best possible experience for their visitors.

<b>We believe your website has one primary purpose: to help your visitors achieve what they came to do with the least amount of time and effort. Your visitors’ and customers’ time is precious. You only get one chance to make a great first impression.</b>

What keeps us up at night isn’t our direct competitors—it’s thinking about all the companies struggling with these challenges. They’re leaving money on the table and missing opportunities.

Helping these companies is what motivates us every day. And we know the solution has to be simple, efficient, and effective.

It’s now 2025, and we’re still working hard toward this goal. We’ve come a long way, but we believe we’ve only scratched the surface.

The best is yet to come.
