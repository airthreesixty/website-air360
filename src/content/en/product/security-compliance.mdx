<BlockFeature title='FAQs'>
  <MdxAccordion title='How does Air360 work?'>Once Air360 pixel is installed on your website when a new visitor lands on it all pages visited, mouse movements, clicks or scrolls are captured by default. However, we do not capture any input field or anything that could contain PII. Air360 also provides APIs and settings to fine tune these settings and make sure no sensitive data is ever captured.</MdxAccordion>
  <MdxAccordion title='What data is collected?'>
  We automatically track every single interaction your users may have on your site.
  - Clicks
  - Scrolling
  - Mouse over
  - Pageview
  - Datalayer information (whitelist based)

  There is only one exception. We will never record what the user types in any text area of your website or app. This is for a very simple reason: We can never know how this information is.

  We also collect information from users’ browsers as:
  Browser language
  - Platform
  - Device
  - Operating system
  - IP address (*)

  (*) IP address is only used to retrieve user’s geolocation, but it is not stored in our database.

  <MdxAccordion title='What types of cookies are used?'>Since October 2024, Air360 doesn't rely on cookies anymore and is a cookie-free solution.</MdxAccordion>
  <MdxAccordion title='Do we collect personal data?'>Air360 does not collect any personal or sensitive data by default. The data that we collect by default can become personal data when you connect with our APIs to push user identifiers or user property data.</MdxAccordion>
  <MdxAccordion title='Does Air360 makes your website or app slower?'>
    One of the questions we often get at Air360 is about how the Air360 pixel could possibly slow down your website. The short answer is no.

    Long answer: The Air360 tracking pixel is loaded asynchronously and at the end of the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag. That means that our script is technically unable to block your website from loading correctly. In addition to that, the Air360 tracking pixel is hosted on a CDN (Cache Delivery Network), which makes the loading latency extremely low. Thanks to our CDN, the JS usually loads under 30 ms. Air360 Javascript also has a very low memory footprint using less than 20KB (gzipped) of bandwidth. This is much smaller than most scripts. It is also much, much smaller than even a tiny low-resolution image. All these measures ensure that Air360 tracking pixel will never slow down user experience when your users navigate your website. In addition to all the measures mentioned above, we continue to monitor & optimize the performance of the Air360 pixel.
