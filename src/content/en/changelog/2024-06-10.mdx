**Improved teamwork**🙌

It is now possible to add descriptions and comments 💬 to funnels, user journeys and events. We believe this will greatly improve collaboration within teams.
This was a heavily requested feature, especially from large teams who had a hard time sharing the context on funnels, user journeys and events: What's the purpose? Is there anything to pay attention to? etc. No more forgotten dates!
The feature is still in its infancy and collaborative feature is clearly something we want/need to improve in Air360!

**Better organization of funnels, user journeys and events**🗂️
Another highly requested feature was to be able to better organize funnels, user journeys and events.
All of these can be now **sorted by owners** (very helpful for large teams) which is now directly displayed in the lists.
The lists are easier to read and you **can now add labels** to funnels and user journeys!

**Better search**🕵🏻
You can now search your funnels, user journeys and events not only on their names or labels but also on their descriptions.
It is also possible to filter by owner!


**Virtual pageviews**✨
There are use cases where you need to manually trigger a pageview event. For example, in Single Page Applications (SPAs) where the page does not refresh and the URL does not change, you might still want to trigger a pageview event. To address this, we have created a new function that sends a pageview event. You can find more information on how to use it [here](https://app.air360.io/docs/quickstart-api/#virtual-pageview).
