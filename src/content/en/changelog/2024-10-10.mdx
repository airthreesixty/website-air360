Good morning all! 🍵

We've been a bit quiet lately, that's because we've been hard at work on some exciting updates (coming soon! 🧁)

**Funnel improvement**✨

Today, we're excited to introduce an improved funnel comparison view.
Our goal with this update is to provide a cleaner, more intuitive way to quickly compare your funnels over various time periods.

The main period is displayed in black while the compared period is in lighter grey. The label gives you a quick indication how well you're doing at each step.

**What's new in the Chrome extension (v3.11.2):**
- Improved display on smaller screen sizes.
- Enhanced handling when creating events that already exist.

**Improved session replays**🍿

This update also brings improvements to session replays. With a new recorder and player, you can expect a smoother viewing experience and greater accuracy in your replays.


**Various improvements**

Additionally, accessing session replays and sessions from the user journey is now easier than ever.

**And, of course, we’ve squashed a few bugs**🦗
- ✅Fixed an issue that prevented renaming user segments.
- ✅Resolved a bug where the tooltip showing the session ID wouldn't disappear automatically in some browsers.
