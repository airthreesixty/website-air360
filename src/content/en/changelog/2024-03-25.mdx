## Several funnel improvements:
- Funnel shows the user retention from previous step by default.
- Funnel shows visitors count from first step of the funnel.
- Adding events to a funnel can be done using search on event name or label name.

## Chrome Plugin improvement (version 3.6.3):
- Tailwind CSS classes are unselected by default in the Chrome Plugin.
- Hesitation time shows as N/A for mobile analysis as it is a non-mobile only metric.

## Other improvements:
- When creating a new label, the label name had to be typed twice.
