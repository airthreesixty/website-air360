**Live Progress Updates in Chrome Plugin**
![](/images/changelog/2024-05-22/1.gif)

The Chrome Plugin now displays a progress indicator while loading data. Previously, it only showed a regular loader without indicating progress. This new feature is particularly useful for pages with heavy traffic, where data analysis can take some time. The progress indicator provides users with real-time updates, making the wait more manageable.

**Note:** This feature may not function behind certain corporate firewalls that block live updates from websites.
