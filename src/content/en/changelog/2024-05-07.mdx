Responding to feedback from our customers, we have decided to no longer require two-factor authentication (2FA). It appears that this decision annoyed many users, and we totally understand.

**Why did we do this?**
We believe it's our responsibility to enforce good security practices. Security is that kind of thing we have to go through but no one enjoys. However, it's also what keeps our back when things go south.
We also get that the timing matters and most of us would like to do it when the timing is right.

**So what now?**
For those who have already enabled it, there's nothing more you need to doâ€”congratulations :)
For everyone else, we have temporarily disabled this requirement. We will introduce an alternative for those who cannot or do not want to use a third-party app for authentication. We are considering adding email-based OTP.
