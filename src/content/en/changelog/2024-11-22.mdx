## New On-Page-Analytics(OPA)
We moved from the chrome extension.
The new OPA needs no downloading on your side to start. All you have to do is download the Air360 pixel, and you'll be able to start analyzing your website with it. Note, that the first time you use the OPA, you would need to follow a few steps.
Please check the help center: https://help.air360.io/getting-started/how-to-start-using-the-on-page-analytics. You would need to be logged on to check the help center.
