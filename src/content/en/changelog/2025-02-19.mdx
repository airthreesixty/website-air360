## Automatic tracking of datalayer push events
This was a popular/requested feedback that will allow us to automatically capture events sent via `dataLayer.Push`
Whenever a `dataLayer.push` will be triggered on a website, this will automatically trigger an `Air360.track()` with the same event.
For example, when a `dataLayer.push({ event: "register" })` is performed, Air360 JS SDK will automatically trigger a `Air360.track("register")`
This can be then used as any other API/custom event in Air360.
**Note:** While you can already use the events here via the usual "Custom events", we're also going to improve the ease of use here, stay tuned!

## Handle label in input type submit/button
This is something we recently saw on a client's website:submit/button label's were not automatically captured until now.
This is now captured by the new JS SDK.
