  <span>Improvements</span>
</Badge>

- There is now a dedicated menu for datalayer properties in the Event creation UI.
- Improved launcher for the new OPA
    - The domains with the most traffic are automatically coming first
    - You can add domains to favorites using the favorite icon
- Limit of 100K sessions on display
    - We previously introduced a display limit of 100K sessions in user journeys to prevent browser performance issues when handling large number of sessions.
    - This limit only affects the number of sessions displayed in the browserâ€”it does not impact the analysis, which still includes all sessions within the selected date range.
