### New Chrome Extension released 👇
**Security Enhancement:** The Chrome Extension now features enhanced security with its own dedicated authentication system, ensuring a more secure and reliable experience.

**Improved on-page analytics experience:** Improved ability to adjust the definition of the element when using the zoning. You can now adjust the definition used when analyzing a given HTML element directly on the page.

**🎉 Autosave 🎉:** This has been a highly requested feature that will save you a significant amount of time. Until now, any page analyzed with Air360 Chrome Extension would lose the selected zones once the extension was closed, resulting in a considerable loss of time. Now, the extension automatically saves all your zoning on a given page. It also preserves any updates you have made to how certain HTML elements should be analyzed (with text, without text, etc.).


**How to benefit from this feature?**

There is nothing for you to do; the autosave functionality works seamlessly in the background, automatically saving your settings and progress for you.
