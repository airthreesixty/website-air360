### Various UX improvements
- Events definition can be seen even when they're in progress.
- User segments can be selected using search dropdown in funnels.
- When a user segment was selected as a dimension, it wasn't shown if no visitor were in the funnel. This wasn't intuitive. Now, user segments are returned even if they do not contain any visitor.
