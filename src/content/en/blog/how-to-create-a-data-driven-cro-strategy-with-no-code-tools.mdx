## Collecting and Understanding User Data

Once your no-code tools are in place, it's time to gather user data that can help you fine-tune your CRO strategy.

### 1\. Setting Up Analytics and Heatmap

Use GA4 to track key conversion goals like newsletter signups, product page views, add-to-carts, checkout completions, and form submissions. Make sure you have enough pageviews for reliable data, and segment by device type to understand how user behavior differs across platforms.

### 2\. Getting Direct User Feedback

Real-time feedback can be a game-changer. Use on-page surveys or feedback widgets to learn directly from users Hotjar offers this . For example, ask new visitors on your homepage what they’re looking for, or find out from product page visitors what might be holding them back from making a purchase. Trigger these surveys strategically - like on exit intent or after users spend a few moments engaging with the page.

> "We discovered a few issues which only required 5 minutes to be resolved. This quick fix boosted our conversion by 40%." - Shiv Sharma, Head of Content at Taskworld [\[6\]](https://www.hotjar.com/heatmaps/how-to-create/)

### 3\. Finding Funnel Problems

Air360’s auto-tracking capabilities make it easier to analyze your funnel. Identify the most valuable entry points and pinpoint where users are dropping off - especially important since the average [cart abandonment rate](/en/blog/how-a-b-testing-can-reduce-cart-abandonment) is 69% [\[1\]](https://vwo.com/conversion-rate-optimization). Session replays can highlight issues like navigation problems, slow-loading sections, missing trust signals, or unclear pricing. Comparing journeys of users who convert versus those who don’t can reveal actionable insights. For instance, BluTV achieved a 42% increase in mobile conversions by removing distractions [\[1\]](https://vwo.com/conversion-rate-optimization).

### 4\. Learn your user behavior with Heatmap

Now that you know where your users dropped off, or where users are frustrated, you can use the heatmap to understand actual user behavior on the website itself. A heatmap will help you transform your user data into actionable test ideas. This step bridges the gap between analysis and implementation.

For example, Materials Market noticed through scroll maps that mobile users couldn't see their main call-to-action (CTA) above the fold. By repositioning and redesigning the CTA, they boosted their conversion rate by 1.1%, adding over $12,000 in yearly revenue [\[7\]](https://contentsquare.com/guides/heatmaps/ux/).

When reviewing heatmap data, pay attention to:

-   Unusual click patterns
    
-   Sections with rage clicks
    
-   Overly focused elements
    
-   CTAs that aren't performing well
    

These insights give you the data you need to confidently test site changes without writing a single line of code.

## Testing Website Changes

Now that you know where needs optimization on your website, it’s time to set up and start testing website change to confirm if it will bring conversion rate optimization.

### 1\. Setting Up No-Code Tests

No-code testing tools like Optimizely and VWO make launching A/B tests straightforward.

-   **Define Clear Goals**  
    Focus on one metric per test, such as increasing add-to-cart clicks or reducing form abandonment.
    
-   **Create Test Variations**  
    Experiment with changes like moving buttons, tweaking headlines, rearranging elements, or adjusting content.
    
-   **Set Up Proper Tracking**  
    Ensure you track both primary and secondary metrics to capture the full impact of your test.
    

> "The concept of A/B testing is simple: show different variations of your website to different people and measure which variation is the most effective at turning them into customers." - Dan Siroker and Pete Koomen [\[8\]](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/ab-testing)

### 2\. Using Test Results

Turum-burum helped Intertop improve their conversion rate by 55% by fixing issues with product filters [\[7\]](https://contentsquare.com/guides/heatmaps/ux/).

When evaluating test results, keep these factors in mind:

-   Aim for 90–95% confidence in statistical significance
    
-   Run tests for at least 7–14 days
    
-   Ensure you have a large enough sample size
    
-   Account for external factors that could influence outcomes
    

Even tests that don't succeed can offer valuable insights. For instance, Bannersnack's UX team used heatmap data to guide A/B tests, leading to a 25% increase in sign-ups through ongoing adjustments [\[7\]](https://contentsquare.com/guides/heatmaps/ux/).

> "Analyzing A/B testing results is one of the most important stages of an experiment. But it's also the least talked about." - Shana Pilewski, Senior Director of Marketing, Dynamic Yield [\[9\]](https://www.dynamicyield.com/lesson/ab-testing-analysis/)

Dive deeper into results by breaking them down by audience segments. This helps you uncover hidden opportunities and make decisions that better serve your most important user groups.

## Growing Your CRO strategy and Program

To keep your CRO program moving forward and deliver better results, it's important to approach growth strategically. By using insights from previous tests, you can take the following steps to expand your efforts effectively.

### Making Small, Regular Updates

Focus on consistent, data-backed changes to improve performance over time. Here are some tools that can help:

-   **Automated tools like Heap**: Instantly track all user interactions.
    
-   **Heatmap, session recordings**: Spot areas where users encounter difficulties.
    
-   **Analytics platforms**: Measure the impact of changes.
    

A great example is Club Med, which boosted conversion rates by 97% after using Air360's auto-tracking. They also improved their booking process to achieve this impressive result [\[12\]](/en).

### Expanding Tests to More Pages

Once you've optimized your key pages, it's time to expand testing across your site. Here's a structured approach:

| Testing Phase | Focus Area | Recommended Tools |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Initial | High-traffic landing pages | Microsoft Clarity (free), Hotjar |
| Intermediate | Product/service pages | Crazy Egg, FullStory |
| Advanced | Entire user journey | Omniconvert, VWO |

Key tips for this phase:

-   Start with high-traffic pages to ensure reliable data.
    
-   Apply successful variations to similar pages.
    
-   Track both primary metrics (like conversion rates) and secondary effects, such as SEO performance [\[11\]](https://unbounce.com/a-b-testing/best-tools/).
    

### Conclusion: No-Code CRO Made Simple

A coding-free, data-focused CRO strategy can make a real difference. While the average website conversion rate sits at 2.35%, top performers manage to surpass 5% - showing there’s plenty of room for improvement[\[14\]](https://www.andava.com/learn/conversion-rate-optimization/).

No-code tools make CRO accessible to everyone. As Theano Dimitrakis, Director of Analytics at NoGood, puts it:
