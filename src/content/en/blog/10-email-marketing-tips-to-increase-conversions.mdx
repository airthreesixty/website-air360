Is email marketing still relevant in 2022? We’ll answer that with a resounding yes.

Impressively, email marketing is still 40 times more effective at reaching your target audience than social media marketing efforts. Perhaps even more incredibly, the number of emails sent and received annually has increased every year since 2017, with 333.2 billion emails sent every day in 2022.

As online shopping continues to increase in popularity, email will play an even more important role in attracting and converting customers. Yet not all email marketing metrics are created equal.

In the modern era, email conversions are one of the most essential metrics for marketers to focus on. After all, the effort you’re putting into email marketing will go to waste if customers aren’t actually doing what you want them to do.

How can DTC eCommerce brands boost conversions? In this post, we’ll highlight the best ways to increase conversion rates in any email marketing campaigns.

## Segment Your Audiences

No matter how great your email content is, if you’re sending it to the wrong audience, it will fall flat. This is why audience segmentation is such a critical part of effective email marketing. Segment your email list based on website user behavior, demographics and purchase history in order to better serve your customers — and quickly boost conversions. In fact, marketers who segment their email campaigns can see a revenue increase of up to 760%.

## Use Dynamic Language

Never underestimate the power of language in email marketing. Since the ideal sales email length is just 50-125 words, it’s important to make every word count. You can optimize your email copy by using active verbs that inspire readers to convert. Be sure to include calls-to-action that connect with your audience, such as “Yes, I want to subscribe!” or “I’m ready to plan my vacation!”

## Leverage AI to Optimize Send Times

In 2022, there’s no need to play the guessing game when it comes to the best time to send your emails. 66% of marketers believe artificial intelligence is an effective way to optimize send times, meaning your competitors are probably already leveraging AI software to know precisely when their audience is most likely to open your email. Jump aboard the trend and watch your open rates and conversions soar.

## Scrub Your Email List

If you’ve ever run a contest or a promotion in order to grow your email list, it’s important to scrub the list from time to time. Though these tactics are a great way to bring in more potential customers, they also might attract irrelevant subscribers who are never going to engage with your emails. Keep in mind that a focused, engaged audience is always more advantageous than a larger audience. By narrowing down your email list, you’ll also increase your conversion rates.

## A/B Test Your Emails

_Whether you’re testing social media ads, landing pages or email campaigns, A/B testing is always a smart move. Astonishingly, brands that always A/B test their emails create an ROI of 48:1. It pays to invest a little extra time and effort to find out which emails are resonating with your audience most._

## Send Cart Abandonment Emails

Still not sending cart abandonment emails? Then there’s no time to waste. Cart abandonment emails have the highest average conversion rates of any type of eCommerce email, highlighting yet another reason they’re such an important market of any email marketing strategy. Encourage customers to finish their purchase by sending an email that reminds them of the products they left in their cart. If they don’t take the bait, consider sending a follow-up email offering a discount on the product.

## Add a Personalized Touch

An overwhelming majority of consumers (80%) want greater personalization from brands, and this trend extends to email marketing. Companies that personalize their interactions with customers on a large scale can see a 1-2% boost in sales, increasing customer loyalty and greater share-of-wallet. Personalized emails don’t have to be complicated to be effective: Start with something as simple as adding the name of the customer or mentioning a product they recently purchased.

## Optimize for Mobile

American consumers spend an average of three hours a day using the internet on a mobile device. It’s unsurprising, then, that 54% of emails are opened on mobile. This is a key insight for email marketers: If you’re not already optimizing your emails for mobile, it’s time to start. When your emails look more appealing on a mobile device, your subscribers will be more likely to convert. Mobile-friendly emails should have a short subject line, concise copy and a design that focuses on CTAs. Remember, not all mobile devices automatically display images, so let your body copy do the talking.

## Create Automated Drip Campaigns

Email drip campaigns are one of the most effective ways to boost conversions. By sending emails at the right time, over regular intervals, you’ll build more trusting relationships with your audience. Automated drip campaigns take your email marketing to the next level, reaching subscribers shortly after they take a specific action on your website. You can send drip emails to keep your brand at top-of-mind, educate your visitors, win back interest or to entice consumers with a promotion.

## Write a Captivating Subject Line

Gone are the days when marketers could throw in a generic subject line and expect customers to get excited about their email. Today, 64% of email subscribers make a decision to open an email based on the subject line. Email conversions start with those first few words your readers see before they open the email. For optimal conversions, keep your subject line to 25-30 characters. Put the most important words at the beginning of the subject, and always highlight the value your brand or product offers.
