**Cookie-based tracking is dying, and privacy-first tracking is the future.** With many of the websites still relying on third-party cookies and 42.2% of users rejecting cookie consent banners, businesses must adapt to protect user privacy while maintaining effective analytics. This guide explains how to shift from traditional tracking to cookieless methods like [server-side tracking](https://www.air360.io/en/blog/revolutionizing-data-tracking), first-party data collection, and privacy-focused browser APIs.

## What is Cookieless Analytics?

Cookieless analytics changes the way tracking works by moving away from using cookies. This shift is driven by stricter data protection laws and growing concerns about user privacy.

### Basic Concepts

Cookieless analytics relies on server-based data collection. It focuses on protecting user privacy while still providing useful insights.

Here’s how it works:

-   **Server-side tracking**: Data is collected on the website's servers instead of the user's browser.
    
-   **First-party data collection**: Information is gathered directly from user interactions on your website.
    
-   **Browser fingerprinting**: Unique user identifiers are created based on device characteristics.
    

> "Cookieless describes a way of marketing in which marketers are less reliant on _cookies,_ which are bits of data that contain consumer personal identifiers" [\[3\]](https://business.adobe.com/blog/basics/cookieless)

These methods highlight the differences between traditional and modern tracking approaches.

### Comparing Old vs New Methods

| Aspect | Traditional Cookie-Based | Cookieless Analytics |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Data Storage** | Stored on user devices | Processed server-side |
| **Privacy Impact** | Raises tracking concerns | Improves user privacy |
| **Compliance** | Requires explicit consent | Eases compliance efforts |
| **Data Quality** | Limited by browser settings | Provides more reliable data |
| **Implementation** | Simple but increasingly limited | More complex but future-ready |

Failing to embrace cookieless tracking could lead to major revenue losses. .

Thus, any strategy to work around this has to align with these data privacy norms." - Able Customer Data Platform Customer Success Team [\[4\]](https://www.ablecdp.com/blog/navigating-marketing-analytics-in-a-cookieless-gdpr-compliant-world)

With 42.2% of users rejecting cookie consent banners [\[1\]](https://improvado.io/blog/cookieless-attribution), adopting cookieless analytics is crucial. It ensures more accurate data collection, respects privacy, and complies with evolving regulations.

## 2 Main Privacy-First Tracking Methods

These methods align with cookieless analytics principles, emphasizing secure and privacy-conscious tracking. They rely on **server-side tracking**, **first-party data collection**, and **privacy-focused browser APIs** to ensure compliance and maintain data integrity.

### 1\. Server-Side Tracking Setup

Server-side tracking shifts data collection to secure servers, ensuring better control over data privacy and accuracy. Here's how you can set it up:

-   **Deploy Server-Side Google Tag Manager (sGTM):** Acting as a middle layer between users and third-party vendors, sGTM improves website performance, refines data quality, and strengthens security measures .
    
-   **Use a consent management platform:**
    
    > "Consent Mode does not make your data collection/processing GDPR-compliant...Compliance is a process rather than a toggle" [\[1\]](https://improvado.io/blog/cookieless-attribution).
    
-   **Establish data protection protocols:** Ensure your data storage complies with regional regulations and apply data hashing before sharing with third parties.
    

Combine server-side tracking with first-party data collection to create a more complete analytics strategy.

### 2\. Browser API Options

Privacy-focused browser APIs provide alternatives to traditional cookies while enabling essential analytics. Google's Privacy Sandbox includes tools like:

-   **Topics API:** Offers broad interest signals based on browsing history.
    
-   **Protected Audience API:** Supports remarketing without cross-site tracking.
    
-   **Attribution Reporting API:** Tracks ad performance without individual-level data.
    

Additionally, the **Storage Access API** allows controlled cross-site content access, and the **Beacon API** supports non-blocking data transmission before a page unloads [\[8\]](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Beacon_API)[\[9\]](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_Access_API). These APIs strike a balance between protecting user privacy and delivering actionable insights for businesses.
